# Welcome to my Portfolio!
I am a multi-talented professional with a passion for data science and artificial intelligence. This repo is a collection of my most recent and relevant projects in various fields. Indeed, thanks to my education at the Supinfo school, I had the opportunity to touch a number of technologies in many areas related to information technology.

## Projects
During my career, I have worked on a wide variety of projects in different areas of IT. I have developed mobile and web applications, both frontend and backend, as well as design and formatting skills. However, my favorite field remains data mining and analysis. I have applied my knowledge in artificial intelligence to create powerful predictive models. In sum, my diversity of projects has allowed me to develop strong and versatile skills in several areas of computer science. However, my growing interest in data science is now leading me to focus on this particular field. I am confident that my technical skills and previous experience will allow me to fully develop in this fascinating field.

## About me
I recently graduated from a Master of Engineering with a Level 7 RNCP title delivered by the Ionis group and Supinfo school. During my studies, I realized many school, professional and personal projects that allowed me to develop my skills in various fields of computer science. With three years of professional experience acquired thanks to my professional training, I worked for different types of companies, including as an auto-entrepreneur.

My experience led me to work as a web developer, but mostly as a data analyst / data scientist. What interests me the most in the world of computer science is data science, and it is in this field that I wish to find my future job. I like to be confronted with complex problems and find innovative solutions using data!

I am a passionate and curious person, who is always looking to learn new things and take on new challenges. I am confident that my education and past experiences will allow me to contribute significantly to future progress.
